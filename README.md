# React Boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate code that provides a solid foundation for starting your React projects. It includes various tools and configurations to enhance your development experience.

## Technologies Included

### ESLint
ESLint is a widely-used JavaScript linter that helps maintain a consistent code style and catch potential errors. It ensures your code adheres to a set of predefined rules and best practices, promoting code quality and readability.

### Prettier
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces consistent code formatting across your project. It automatically formats your code to a predefined style, eliminating unnecessary debates about code formatting and ensuring a clean and consistent codebase.

### Vite
Vite is a fast, modern build tool for web applications. It enables rapid development with instant hot module replacement (HMR) and blazing fast builds. Vite maximizes the development speed by leveraging modern browser capabilities and optimized bundling techniques.

### Husky
Husky is a powerful Git hook manager that allows you to automate tasks and enforce quality control at different stages of your development workflow. It helps to ensure that certain scripts, such as linting and testing, are run automatically before committing or pushing code.

### lint-staged
lint-staged is a tool that optimizes the linting process by running linters only on the staged files. It significantly reduces the time required for linting by focusing only on the files that are part of the current changeset. lint-staged integrates seamlessly with Git hooks and works well with Husky.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to your codebase. It helps catch errors early, provides enhanced tooling support, and improves code maintainability. TypeScript enables you to write more reliable and scalable code by adding static types to JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To use this boilerplate code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Open the `package.json` file and update the `"name"` field to your desired project name.

4. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

5. Start the development server:

This will launch the development server and you can access your React application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Begin building your React application by modifying the code and adding your components and logic.

Feel free to customize and extend this boilerplate code to suit the specific needs of your project.
